Breakdown:

Part 1 and 2 went on without a hitch.

Part 3 was not necessarily needed as the logic to calculate the average between
numbers was correctly implemented on the first go-through but System.out.print()
could have been used to debug the section if need be

In part 4- based off my debugging and stepping into-out of my functions and
break points I *think* the NullPointerException occurs at line 20 and line 28 for the
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. But that is simply where the errors are thrown.
Line 45 is where the NullPointerException breaks out of the loop upon further examination.
Whereas line 26 is where the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception ACTUALLY takes place.

5. Partially seen in the section above. I used the debugger to trace these issues
by placing breakpoints where I had run the programs with the variables/methods
that I thought were causing the problems and stepped through the functions as they were
running and got to see exactly where the program failed.

6./.7 I introduced a bug in my calculateAverage function where the sum of the
array of integers was divided by 10 rather than the size of the ArrayList.
In a similar fashion to the above section. I placed breakpoint(s) where I had assumed
the *very intentional* error was placed and lo and behold the incorrect output occurred
at line 48 (technically moved to line 51 after commenting and implementing the
correct solution).
